# Rally-Dashboard
In the beginning, this project was aimed for a Mitsubishi Pajero 2nd Gen, however due to the impossibility of finding a way to read the MUT-II (Sent an email to Mitsubishi France) on my prototype, I decided to switch to cars with an OBD-II dangle, being an international standard, it could help me more to work and progress in my project.

## What is this project ?
This project is a mini on board computer, aiming to collect data from the OBD-II (MUT-II before) port, and sending to a dedicated mobile application, to receive any information necessary for a team during a race, since the co-pilot will read these informations (like the speed, the RPM, the engine's temperature...)

## What is the aim of this project ?
- Learn about Embedded Systems.
- Receive Data fron the ECU to display them in a way to be more understanble for the co-pilot.
- Offer Rally (or racing in general) teams, the possibility to see the state of their vehicule and decide upon it.

## Materials used:
- Will be displayed in the future.

## Used programs:
- Will be displayed in the future

## General Use:
- You will find Schematics in the folder *Schematics*, how the ESP32 receive and treats data, and how does it communicate with the mobile app.

## Displayed Data:
- Will be displayed in the future.

## Mobile Application:
- You will find the code for the app later in the folder *Mobile App*, wth a readme file explaining it, pictures and screenshots to illustrate it.

## TESTS:
- An update will be given according to the vehicule used.

## Licence & Credits:
- Later.
